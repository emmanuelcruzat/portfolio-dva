        <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          I’m Emmanuel Cruzat, and I'm passionate about cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, web
          development, and turning cool ideas into marketable products. I’ve led student engineering
          organizations, worked on large technical projects, and built software both in and out of
          the classroom.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          I've got experience with a wide range of programming languages, including Python, Java,
          and C/C++. I've also worked with web development frameworks, like the MEAN stack.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          When I'm not doing any of that, I'll probably be editing videos, learning languages,
          building rockets, or taking my telescope out to do some stargazing. Oh, or I could be
          playing video games. Or taking a nap too... this stuff is tiring, alright?
