        <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          I’m a third-year computer science student at NJIT. interests sit at the intersection of
          software engineering, cybersecurity, and leadership. I’ve led student engineering
          organizations, worked on large technical projects, and built projects both in and out of
          the classroom.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          Outside of code, I’m into rocketry, world-building, writing, and learning languages (the
          regular kind!) — anything that brings some creativity into my very technical-focused life.
